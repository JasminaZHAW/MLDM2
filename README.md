# MLDM2 Course Tutorials 
### (adapted from https://github.com/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks)

The tutorials have been integrated as official tutorials of PyTorch Lightning.

## How to run the notebooks
There are two main ways of running the notebooks:

### Locally on CPU: 
All notebooks are stored in this git repository. The notebooks are designed so that you can execute them on common laptops without the necessity of a GPU. The pretrained models are automatically downloaded when running the notebooks. The required disk space for the pretrained models and datasets is less than 1GB. To ensure that you have all the right python packages installed, there is a conda environment in the same repository (choose the CPU or GPU version depending on your system).

### Google Colab: 
If you prefer to run the notebooks on a different platform than your own computer, or want to experiment with GPU support, we recommend using Google Colab. Remember to enable GPU support before running the notebook (Runtime -> Change runtime type).
